# Java 9 Hacks

Java 9 hacks that rely on some nasty mechanisms to work. Separated for keeping referring projects clean.

MIT license, cos everyone should be able to use this. So gross.

Current hacks:
1. Get URLs from system classloader. Original at stack overflow, of course: https://stackoverflow.com/a/46709196


## Testing

Run the testsuite with a variety of Java versions. I recommend Java 8 and 10 for best compatibility.

## Distribution

The distribution is build with Java 8 because it is maximally compatible.
